</head>
<body>
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 18.10.2024</p>

    <p><em>Squishy's World Demo</em> ("the game") is developed and operated by Transylvanian Tales ("we", "us", "our"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle personal data in relation to your use of the game.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p style = "margin-bottom: 0px">We want to make it clear that the game does not collect any personal or non-personal data from its users. This includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
    <ul style = "margin-top: 0px">
        <li>No personal information such as names, addresses, emails, or phone numbers.</li>
        <li>No device information such as IP addresses, device identifiers, or location.</li>
        <li>No usage analytics or tracking data.</li>
        <li>No third-party advertisements or tracking through ad networks.</li>
        <li>No leaderboards or in-game communication that requires data sharing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Since the game does not collect any personal information, it complies with regulations protecting children’s privacy, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The game is safe for all ages and does not require any parental consent or intervention for data collection because there is no data collection.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The game does not use any third-party services, such as analytics providers or social media platforms, that would collect or process personal data.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>Although the game does not collect personal information, we prioritize the protection of any non-personal data that might incidentally come from usage of the platform (such as error logs). However, as no personal information is collected, there is no specific data stored on our servers related to player identity.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect updates to the game or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted within the app or through the Google Play listing. We recommend reviewing this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
